2. Simulate page refresh
3. Verify form data recovery

**Expected**: Form restores all previously entered data
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

- Form data completely restored
- Step progression maintained
- All field values preserved

### 4. localStorage Cleanup After Submission ✅

**Test**: Submit form successfully
**Steps**:

1. Fill complete form
2. Submit successfully
3. Check localStorage

**Expected**: localStorage cleared after successful submission
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

- localStorage.removeItem called with 'fms_form_data'
- No trace of form data remains

### 5. localStorage Not Cleared on Failed Submission ✅

**Test**: Submit form with error
**Steps**:

1. Fill form
2. Trigger submission error
3. Check localStorage

**Expected**: Form data preserved for retry
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

- localStorage not cleared
- Form data available for retry

### 6. Error Handling - Corrupted Data ✅

**Test**: Load form with corrupted localStorage data
**Steps**:

1. Set invalid JSON in localStorage
2. Load form

**Expected**: Form handles gracefully with default values
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

- Form renders with empty fields
- No crashes or errors
- Graceful fallback to defaults

### 7. Error Handling - Storage Quota Exceeded ✅

**Test**: Simulate localStorage quota exceeded
**Steps**:

1. Mock localStorage.setItem to throw quota error
2. Fill form fields

**Expected**: Form continues to function despite errors
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

- Form fields remain editable
- No functionality loss
- Errors handled gracefully

### 8. Form Abandonment Tracking ✅

**Test**: Start form but navigate away without submitting
**Steps**:

1. Enter some data
2. Navigate away/refresh
3. Check analytics events

**Expected**: Analytics abandonment event fired
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

- gtag event 'fms_form_abandon' fired
- Includes step number and time spent
- Custom parameters included correctly

### 9. No Abandonment Tracking for Unused Forms ✅

**Test**: Load form but don't interact
**Steps**:

1. Load form
2. Navigate away without entering data

**Expected**: No abandonment event fired
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

- No gtag events fired
- Correctly detects unused form

### 10. No Abandonment Tracking After Successful Submission ✅

**Test**: Submit form successfully, then navigate away
**Steps**:

1. Fill and submit form
2. Navigate away after success

**Expected**: No abandonment event fired
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

- Success page shows correctly
- No abandonment tracking after submission

### 11. Server-Side Rendering Compatibility ✅

**Test**: Verify localStorage not accessed during SSR
**Steps**:

1. Check component code for typeof window checks
2. Verify conditional localStorage access

**Expected**: localStorage only accessed in browser
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

- Proper typeof window !== 'undefined' checks
- No localStorage access during SSR

### 12. Large Form Data Handling ✅

**Test**: Enter very long text in goals field
**Steps**:

1. Enter 5000+ character goals text
2. Navigate between steps
3. Verify data persistence

**Expected**: Large data handled correctly
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

- Large text saved and restored correctly
- No performance issues
- Data integrity maintained

## Code Analysis Findings

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: localStorage errors handled gracefully
2. **SSR Compatibility**: Proper client-side checks
3. **Complete Data Persistence**: All form fields saved
4. **Cleanup Logic**: Proper data removal after submission
5. **Analytics Integration**: Abandonment tracking well implemented

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Data Versioning**: No versioning scheme for localStorage data structure
2. **Storage Encryption**: Sensitive data stored in plain text
3. **Expiration Logic**: No automatic data expiration
4. **Compression**: No compression for large datasets

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Add Data Versioning**: Implement versioning to handle schema changes

   ```javascript
   const FORM_DATA_VERSION = '1.0'
   const storageKey = `fms_form_data_v${FORM_DATA_VERSION}`
   ```

2. **Add Data Expiration**: Implement TTL for stored form data
   ```javascript
   const formDataWithExpiry = {
     data: formData,
     expiry: Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
   }
   ```

### Medium Priority

3. **Add Storage Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive PII data
4. **Implement Data Compression**: Compress large text fields
5. **Add Storage Quota Monitoring**: Warn users when storage is full

### Low Priority

6. **Add Migration Logic**: Handle data structure changes
7. **Implement Cross-Tab Sync**: Sync form state across browser tabs
8. **Add Debug Mode**: Include localStorage debug information

## Test Summary

- **Total Tests**: 12
- **Passed**: 12
- **Failed**: 0
- **Success Rate**: 100%

## Conclusion

The FMS form localStorage implementation is robust and well-designed. It handles all major scenarios including error conditions, data persistence, and cleanup. The implementation follows best practices for client-side storage and integrates well with the broader form functionality.

The few areas identified for improvement are primarily related to data versioning and security enhancements rather than functional issues. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for form state persistence.
