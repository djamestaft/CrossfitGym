# Geelong Movement Co — Competitor Analysis (MVP)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 12, 2025
**Prepared by:** Mary (Business Analyst)

## Executive Summary

The Geelong and Surf Coast functional fitness market is competitive and trial‑heavy. Local CrossFit boxes and corporate HIIT franchises (F45, BFT) emphasize low‑friction trials and community signals. Our advantaged wedge is **assessment‑led onboarding (FMS)** and **physio‑integrated coaching** that de‑risks starting or returning to training. The go‑to‑market should position **assessment > free class**, surface credible proof (coach quals, member stories), and funnel visitors to **FMS leads** rather than class bookings (per MVP constraints).

**Primary recommendation:** Own the “**Start Smart: Screen → Plan → Train**” story for Geelong. Ship parity table‑stakes (read‑only timetable, trust bar, drop‑in info) and double‑down on condition hubs and member stories to win intent beyond brand searches.

## 2) Competitive Grid (parity vs. differentiation)

| Competitor           | Likely Positioning                | Trial Construct                 | Pricing Disclosure | Timetable Access | Physio/Assessment                       | Content Depth  | Notable Hooks           | Risk to Us                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| CrossFit Geelong     | “Original/local authority”        | Free trial/intro common         | Gated or partial   | Visible          | No integrated physio; standard on‑ramp  | Light‑moderate | Longevity, community    | Strong brand familiarity        |
| CrossFit Raven       | Coaching‑first, fundamentals      | Intro/on‑ramp                   | Gated              | Visible          | Assessment implied via fundamentals     | Light‑moderate | Structured progression  | Lower activation friction vs us |
| CrossFit Barwon      | Transparent and approachable      | Free/no‑sweat intro             | **Public** pricing | Visible          | No integrated physio                    | Light          | Clear drop‑in rules     | Price‑anchoring expectations    |
| CrossFit Bells Beach | Performance & recovery hub        | Likely trial                    | Gated              | Visible          | Recovery amenities (sauna, cold plunge) | Light          | Amenity prestige        | Amenity envy; Surf Coast draw   |
| F45 Geelong West     | Chain HIIT format                 | Frequent low‑cost/“free” trials | Gated              | Visible          | No assessment; standardized format      | Light          | Ubiquity, convenience   | Ads/promos set expectations     |

**Table‑stakes to match**: read‑only timetable, clear “how to start,” social proof (reviews), coach credentials/bios, concise drop‑in page.
**Where we win**: assessment‑led start (**FMS**), **physio on‑site**, condition‑hub content, and **safety + progress** narrative.

## 3) SWOT — Geelong Movement Co

**Strengths**

- Physio‑integrated coaching; credible **FMS‑first** pathway.
- Clear “train around pain” promise suitable for return‑to‑training segment.
- Ability to publish evidence‑led condition hubs and member stories.

**Weaknesses**

- No free trial (by design) vs. a market accustomed to trials.
- Manual scheduling for FMS in MVP (longer time to confirmation if ops lag).
- Newer brand equity vs established boxes/chains.

**Opportunities**

- Capture underserved **pain‑aware** demand with clear, reassuring content.
- Differentiate with **testing/re‑testing cadence** and outcomes tracking.
- Leverage drop‑ins to seed reviews and word‑of‑mouth.

**Threats**

- Aggressive promotional cycles from chains.
- Amenities‑led positioning from Surf Coast competitors.
- Consumer confusion equating FMS with a paywall vs “free trial.”

---

## 4) Messaging Counterpoints (competitor‑specific)

**Against “Free Trial” claims (generic)**

- _Counter:_ “Trials test your nerves; screens test your movement. Start with a plan, not guesswork.”
- _Proof:_ 15–20 min FMS → tailored first‑week plan; member stories of safer starts.

**CrossFit Geelong**

- _Their likely angle:_ heritage/OG status, community.
- _Our counter:_ “Start smarter, not just sooner.” Emphasize assessment + physio oversight for confidence.
- _CTA:_ **Book your FMS** (not a class).

**CrossFit Raven**

- _Their likely angle:_ fundamentals/on‑ramp before classes.
- _Our counter:_ “Screen before on‑ramp.” Position FMS as pre‑fundamentals diagnostic.

**CrossFit Barwon**

- _Their likely angle:_ transparent, approachable, clear drop‑in.
- _Our counter:_ Match parity (timetable, drop‑in clarity); out‑position with FMS + condition hubs; avoid price wars.

**CrossFit Bells Beach**

- _Their likely angle:_ recovery amenities and performance vibe.
- _Our counter:_ Rehab‑to‑performance path with **clinical** guidance > amenities; show objective progress/re‑tests.

**F45/BFT**

- _Their likely angle:_ format simplicity, schedule density, trials.
- _Our counter:_ Individual readiness and safety; **screened start** + strength basics; “not just sweat—progress you can see.”

## 5) Parity Checklist (MVP must‑haves)

- **Timetable page (read‑only):** fast, mobile‑friendly, linked in header/footer.
- **Trust bar (above the fold):** coach quals, review stars, “physio on‑site.”
- **Drop‑in page:** rules, fee, confirmation steps, map/parking.
- **Coach bios:** certifications, specialties (pain‑aware progressions).
- **FAQ:** “Will CrossFit worsen my pain?”, “What happens in an FMS?”, “Do I need to be fit first?”

---

## 6) Differentiation Assets (to build/feature)

- **FMS Explainer** with plain‑language walkthrough and “after your screen” roadmap.
- **Condition hubs:** Shoulder, knee, low back, mobility/return. Practical regressions/progressions.
- **Member stories library:** return‑to‑training wins; beginner confidence; performance case studies.
- **Testing & re‑testing cadence:** simple calendar and metrics snapshot (e.g., overhead ROM, squat depth, hinge pattern).
- **Clinical + coaching collaboration:** show how findings flow into programming.

---

## 7) Trial‑Alternative Constructs (ethical echoes)

- **“Start Smart Week”**: FMS + two guided intros (framed as _coached starts_, not free classes).
- **“Pain‑Smart Pathway”**: FMS → 1:1 movement tutorial → class selector; bundle priced, but MVP page touts the **assessment**, not the price.
- **“Performance Baseline”**: FMS + performance testing battery (for athletes), optional follow‑up.

> Note: Keep all CTAs anchored to **Book your FMS**; explain what comes next so it feels like a _start_, not a gate.

---

## 8) Search & Reviews (directional focus)

- **Local SEO:** Optimize GBP categories/services, photos, hours; post updates (FMS, drop‑in).
- **SERP intent:** Own “CrossFit Geelong,” “functional movement screen Geelong,” “train around pain,” and drop‑in queries.
- **Review program:** Prompt drop‑ins and Week‑1 completers; surface snippets in proof bars.

---

## 9) Experiments Tailored to Competition

1. **Hero framing vs trial‑heavy market** — A: “Stronger, pain‑smart training—Book your FMS.” B: “Start CrossFit safely—15–20 min screen.” _KPI:_ FMS submit rate.
2. **Proof modules** — A: Coach quals + reviews + physio badge vs B: Member outcomes + reviews + physio badge. _KPI:_ CTA click → FMS submits.
3. **Drop‑in cross‑sell** — After timetable view, show an unobtrusive “new here?” teaser to FMS for visitors staying ≥1 week. _KPI:_ timetable→FMS CTR.
4. **KB inline CTA tone** — “Unsure where to start?” vs “Train around pain.” _KPI:_ KB→FMS CTR and downstream submits.

---

## 10) Ops Guardrails (to beat competitors on experience)

- **Response time:** SMS within 15 minutes; call within 4 hours during business hours.
- **Scheduling clarity:** Offer AM/PM choice on thank‑you; confirm within stated window.
- **No‑show reduction:** Reminders; prep email with what to bring and what to expect.
- **Accessibility:** Clear copy, alt text, color contrast, mobile forms.

---

## 11) Roadmap Tie‑In (next 4–12 weeks)

- **Amenities expansion** (recovery, facilities) vs **clinical claims**.
- **Review velocity** and themes (pain/safety mentions vs intensity/“hardcore”).
- **SERP changes**: Local pack entrants, feature snippets for condition queries.
