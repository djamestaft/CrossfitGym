## 1) Objectives & Scope

### Project Context

* **Offer:** CrossFit + Physiotherapy under one roof.
* **MVP focus:** Convert visitors to **FMS (Functional Movement Screen) leads**, show a **read‑only timetable**, launch a **member portal**, and publish a credible **blog/KB**.
* **Key constraints:** Keep Fitbox as classes source (**upcoming only**, no on‑site booking). **Lead‑gen first** for Physio (Cliniko embed can follow post‑MVP).

### Primary Objective

Quantify and validate **local demand and conversion drivers** for an **FMS‑first lead funnel** in the Geelong catchment, so homepage messaging, CTAs, and early content directly increase **weekly FMS leads** and **show‑ups**.

### Secondary Objectives

1. **Competitive position & table stakes:** Map local CrossFit boxes and corporates (e.g., BFT, F45) to identify norms, messaging angles, pricing signals, and trust assets to match/exceed.
2. **Content/SEO strategy:** Determine evidence‑backed **condition hubs** and KB taxonomy that support the Physio × CrossFit flywheel and organic growth.
3. **Audience & journeys:** Clarify segments (new‑to‑CrossFit, return‑to‑training with pain, performance‑seekers, **drop‑in travelers**) and their paths to FMS.
4. **Channel priorities:** Validate which levers (Local SEO, reviews, referral mechanics, chat prompts) most influence FMS conversion within MVP constraints.

### Decisions This Research Must Inform

* **Positioning & messaging** for homepage hero + FMS CTA.
* **Navigation emphasis** (Training, Physio, Learn, Memberships) and persistent **Book FMS** CTA placement.
* **Content plan:** Priority condition hubs, KB articles, member stories, and review strategy to establish authority.
* **Operational toggles alignment** (no on‑site booking; Cliniko deferred; chat consent‑aware).

### Scope Boundaries & Assumptions

* **Geography:** Greater Geelong + commuter suburbs; include **drop‑in traveler** lens.
* **Timeframe:** Insights to support a \~4‑week MVP launch window; recommendations must fit current toggles (no free trial at launch).
* **Data sources (initial):** Desk research (local SERPs, competitor sites, GMB profiles, review themes), plus site analytics and GA4 events once live.
* **Out of scope (MVP research):** Paid media testing, on‑site booking flow design, full pricing elasticity modeling.

### Success Criteria (for this deliverable)

* A crisp **positioning statement** + 3–5 **message pillars** tied to FMS conversion.
* A **competitor landscape** grid with minimum viable parity & differentiators (Physio on‑site, FMS‑first, KB depth, portal value).
* A **keyword/topic map** for “Learn/KB + condition hubs,” sized for near‑term wins.
* **Channel recommendations** prioritized by impact vs. effort within MVP toggles.

## 2) Research Questions & Methodology

### Key Research Questions (RQs)

* **RQ1 (Demand):** How many people locally search for CrossFit/strength training and physio‑related pain/performance topics monthly?
* **RQ2 (Conversion):** Which **FMS‑first** messages, CTAs, and proof points most increase lead submissions and show‑ups?
* **RQ3 (Category norms):** What are local table‑stakes for programming, coaching bios, pricing signals, schedule transparency, reviews, and trial constructs (without offering a free trial at launch)?
* **RQ4 (Differentiation):** How salient is **Physio on‑site** and “train around pain” vs. corporate group‑training and nearby CrossFit boxes?
* **RQ5 (Journey friction):** Where do prospects drop (SERP → site → FMS form), and what content/UX removes objections?
* **RQ6 (Content/SEO):** Which **condition hubs** and KB topics present near‑term organic wins?

### Method Mix & Data Plan

1. **Local SERP & GMB audit (desk research)** — Capture top queries, SERP features, local pack entrants, and review volumes/ratings. Extract competitor value props, CTAs, trial constructs, schedule visibility, and “physio integration” claims.
2. **Competitor landscape grid** — Compare CrossFit boxes + corporates on: category signals (WOD/programming), trust assets (reviews, coach creds), **FMS/assessment offer**, physio access, pricing cues, timetable transparency, and UX blockers.
3. **Audience insight (qual)** — 10–12 micro‑interviews: segments—new‑to‑CrossFit, return‑to‑training with pain, performance‑seekers, **drop‑in travelers**. On‑site intercept prompts (post‑launch) after timetable views or KB reads.
4. **Keyword & topic mapping (quant + qual)** — Build clusters for: CrossFit Geelong intent, rehab/performance conditions, mobility/pain, return‑to‑sport, brand queries. Prioritize by estimated volume, difficulty, and intent match to **FMS** and Physio pages.
5. **Funnel & experiment plan** — Track: impressions → local pack clicks → landing → scroll depth → FMS form starts/completes → contact rate → show‑ups. A/B test **Hero + CTA**, proof bar, timetable placement, and KB → FMS inline CTA.
6. **Sizing (directional TAM/SAM/SOM)** — Provide top‑down ranges and bottom‑up sanity checks (site traffic × CVR × show‑up rate).

### Instruments & Artifacts

* **Templates:** SERP/GMB capture sheet, competitor card, interview guide (by segment), topic cluster sheet, experiment brief, KPI dashboard spec.
* **Consent language:** Short, plain‑language notice for on‑site intercepts; opt‑out + data minimization.

---

## 3) Competitive Landscape (Local)

### Who’s in the arena (illustrative)

* **CrossFit (local boxes):** CrossFit Geelong, CrossFit Raven, CrossFit Barwon, CrossFit Bells Beach (Surf Coast).
* **Chains (corporate group‑training):** F45 (Geelong West), BFT (Geelong West/North), others as applicable.

### Category Table‑Stakes (to match or beat)

* **Schedule visibility** (read‑only is fine for MVP).
* **Low‑friction trial constructs** are common (we’ll position **assessment > free class**).
* **Social proof cues** (reviews, community language, coach creds) used across sites and socials.

### Differentiation Signals We Can Lean Into

* **Physio on‑site / FMS‑first**: assessment‑led onboarding with train‑around‑pain credibility.
* **Evidence‑led content**: condition hubs & KB that map pain → safe progressions.
* **Recovery vs. Rehab**: competitors emphasize amenities; we emphasize **clinical guidance + progress testing**.

### Parity Checklist for MVP

* **Visible timetable (read‑only)** on site.
* **Trust bar** above the fold (coach creds, review score snippets, **physio on‑site**).
* **Clear drop‑in guidance** for travelers.

### First Positioning Draft (to validate)

> **Hero:** “Stronger, pain‑smart training — start with a Functional Movement Screen.”
> **Sub:** “CrossFit coaching with physiotherapy on site. Train confidently, progress faster.”
> **Primary CTA:** “Book your FMS.”
> **Proof bar:** Coach qualifications • Member stories • “Physio on site.”

## 4) Audience & Segmentation

### Primary Segments (MVP focus)

1. **Return‑to‑training (with pain/history)**
   **JTBD:** Get back to training confidently without flare‑ups.
   **Objections:** “CrossFit will make it worse,” fear of intensity, past experiences.
   **Proof:** FMS‑led onboarding, physio oversight, scaled programming examples.
   **CTA:** **Book your FMS** (15–20 min | no obligation).

2. **New‑to‑CrossFit (cautious starters)**
   **JTBD:** Start strength training safely with guidance.
   **Objections:** Intimidation; “too hardcore”; injury fear.
   **Proof:** Coach bios/quals, week‑1 roadmap, intro movement screen.
   **CTA:** **Book your FMS** → personalized starting plan.

3. **Performance‑seekers (aspiring/comp athletes)**
   **JTBD:** Identify weak links and level up performance.
   **Objections:** “Screens are for beginners,” time cost.
   **Proof:** FMS → targeted correctives; testing battery; performance case studies.
   **CTA:** **Book an FMS + performance plan** (bundle upsell).

4. **Drop‑in travelers**
   **JTBD:** Get a quality session while visiting without hassle.
   **Objections:** Unclear rules; payment friction.
   **Proof:** Coach quality, convenient class times, easy confirmation.
   **CTA:** **View timetable** → **Drop‑in info** (rules, fee, confirmation).

### Segment Sizing (directional for planning)

* **Initial lead mix target:** Return‑to‑training 40–50% • New‑to‑CF 25–35% • Performance 10–20% • Drop‑ins 10–15% (more review drivers than FMS leads).
* **Validation plan:** Tag FMS form with “reason for visit”; attribute KB article paths; review call outcomes.

### Journey Snapshots (SERP → Site → Action)

* **Pain‑led visitor:** Symptom/condition search → KB article (credible, practical) → inline **“See if you’re ready to train”** CTA → FMS form → confirmation email sets expectations.
* **New starter:** Brand/“CrossFit Geelong” query → Home hero proof bar → “How we start” → FMS CTA → timetable skim → FMS confirm.
* **Performance:** “CrossFit performance assessment”/brand query → Program page → Testing/assessment module → FMS+plan bundle CTA.
* **Drop‑in:** “CrossFit drop‑in Geelong” query → Drop‑in page → clear fee & rules → WhatsApp/call button + timetable.

### Message Pillars (site‑wide)

1. **Screen‑first safety** — FMS‑led start reduces guesswork and risk.
2. **Physio‑integrated coaching** — Decisions guided by clinical insight.
3. **Progress you can see** — Baseline → tailored plan → re‑test.
4. **Community + credibility** — Coach quals, member outcomes, reviews.

### On‑page SEO Scaffolding (examples)

**Home**

* *Title:* CrossFit Geelong with Physio On‑Site | Start Smart with an FMS
* *H1:* Stronger, pain‑smart training — start with a Functional Movement Screen
* *Meta:* Begin with a 15–20 min movement screen, then train confidently with rehab‑aware coaching in Geelong.
* *Above‑the‑fold proof bar:* Coach quals • Member outcomes • ★ Reviews • Physio on‑site.

**FMS Explainer**

* *Title:* Functional Movement Screen (FMS) in Geelong | Assess → Plan → Train
* *H1:* Start with an assessment, not a guess
* *Sections:* What is FMS • Who it’s for • What to expect • After your screen • FAQs • CTA.

**Timetable (read‑only)**

* *Title:* CrossFit Timetable — Class Times in Geelong
* *H1:* Class timetable
* *Body:* Live schedule embed (read‑only) + “how to choose your first class” + CTA back to FMS.

**Drop‑in**

* *Title:* CrossFit Drop‑In Geelong — Welcome Visitors
* *H1:* Train with us while you’re in town
* *Body:* Who can drop‑in • Fee & how to confirm • Map/parking • Etiquette • Timetable link.

### Internal Linking & UX Prompts

* **Persistent CTA:** “Book your FMS” in header + within condition hubs, KB, and timetable page.
* **Contextual links:** Each condition article links → (a) relevant regressions guide, (b) FMS Explainer, (c) coach bios.
* **End‑of‑article module:** “Unsure where to start? Get screened” with micro‑proof (review star + count).

### Structured Data (MVP)

* **Organization/LocalBusiness** (NAP, geo, hours), **HealthClub**/**SportsActivityLocation** for the gym, **MedicalBusiness** for physio context, **Service** for FMS, **FAQPage** on FMS & Drop‑in pages, **BreadcrumbList** sitewide, **ItemList** for timetable classes (read‑only is fine).
* Avoid **Offer/AggregateOffer** until pricing strategy is finalized.

## 6) Funnel & Experiment Plan (Weeks 1–4)

### Funnel Definition (end‑to‑end)

**Awareness → Consideration → Intent → Lead → Contacted → Scheduled → Show‑up → Screened**

* **Sources:** Local SEO (GMB/Maps + organic), referrals, socials.
* **Key site states:** Landing → Hero/proof scan → CTA click → **FMS form start** → **FMS form submit** → Thank‑you (expectations) → Staff outreach (SMS/call) → **FMS scheduled** (manual) → **FMS show‑up** → Screen complete.
* **Constraints baked in:** **No free trial**, **no on‑site booking**.

### Events & Properties (GA4/GTM + lightweight CRM)

**Core web events**

* `cta_click` {`loc`: hero|proofbar|inline|footer, `cta`: book\_fms|view\_timetable|drop\_in}
* `fms_form_start` {`source`: page\_slug, `segment_hint`: new|return|performance|null}
* `fms_form_submit` {`reason`: selected, `time_pref`: am|pm|null}
* `view_timetable` {`classes_seen`: int}
* `kb_article_view` {`cluster`: shoulder|knee|back|mobility|fms|story}
* `call_click` / `whatsapp_click`
* `scroll_50`

**Off‑site/CRM events**

* `contact_attempted` {`mode`: sms|call|email}
* `contact_connected` {`ttr_hours`: float}
* `fms_scheduled` {`daypart`: am|pm, `lag_days`: int}
* `fms_showup` (boolean) / `fms_noshow`
* `fms_completed`
* (Optional) `post_fms_path` {class\_intro|physio\_followup|both}

**Attribution note:** Persist `utm_*` (and any ad platform click IDs) into hidden form fields and CRM rows on `fms_form_submit`.

### MVP Dashboard (weekly)

* **Top‑line:** Sessions → `cta_click` rate → `fms_form_start` → **FMS leads (`fms_form_submit`)** → **Contact connect rate** → **Scheduled rate** → **Show‑up rate** → **Screens completed**.
* **By source:** Local pack, organic, direct/referral, socials.
* **By path:** KB→FMS vs Home→FMS vs Timetable→FMS.
* **Latency:** Median **time‑to‑contact**; median **lag days** to scheduled.
* **Quality hints:** % leads selecting “return‑to‑training (pain)” vs “new to CrossFit” vs “performance”.

### Initial Targets (directional; calibrate after Week 1)

* **FMS leads/week:** 8–12 (Weeks 1–2), ramp to **12–18** by Week 4.
* **Form submit rate:** ≥ **35%** of form starters.
* **Contact connect:** ≥ **70%** within **24h**; median **TTR ≤ 4h**.
* **Scheduled rate (from connected):** ≥ **80%**.
* **Show‑up rate (from scheduled):** **70–80%**.
* **KB assist rate:** ≥ **25%** of leads touched a KB page pre‑submit.

### Experiment Backlog (ICE‑prioritized)

**P0 (run first)**

1. **Hero message + CTA** — Variant A: pain‑smart positioning; Variant B: “start safely” framing. KPI: FMS submit rate.
2. **Proof bar composition** — A: coach quals + ★ reviews + “Physio on‑site.” B: member outcomes + ★ reviews + “Physio on‑site.” KPI: CTA click → FMS submits.
3. **KB inline CTA framing** — A: “Unsure where to start? Get screened.” B: “Train around pain: Book your FMS.” KPI: KB→FMS CTR; downstream submits.

**P1 (after Week 2)**
4\) **Timetable prominence** (nav vs header). KPI: timetable views → FMS submits.
5\) **FMS form friction** — A: phone optional, single‑step vs B: phone required, 2‑step. KPI: start→submit, contactability.
6\) **Thank‑you expectation** — A: “We’ll contact you within 24h.” vs B: “Pick AM/PM and we’ll confirm within 2h.” KPI: contact connected; lag to scheduled.

**Run rules:** 1 test per surface at a time; minimum 200–300 unique landers per variant (or 2 weeks) before reading; non‑overlapping audiences where possible.

## 7) Sizing & Forecast (Directional)

> **Approach:** Avoid hard census figures; instead provide a transparent, adjustable model you can tune as data arrives. Two‑part model: **top‑down intent** × **bottom‑up funnel**.

### A) Top‑Down Intent (illustrative ranges)

* **Monthly local searches** (CrossFit/strength + physio/pain topics): assume **3,000–6,000** relevant impressions across brand, category, and condition queries (SERP audit will refine).
* **Achievable organic + Maps clicks (Month 1):** **300–500** visits (10–12% CTR blended).
* **Month‑over‑month lift (by Week 4 launch footprint):** +20–40% with P0 content + GBP optimization.

### B) Bottom‑Up Funnel (scenarios)

Let **Sessions/mo = 1,000 (Conservative) | 1,400 (Base) | 1,800 (Upside)**.

* **CTA click‑through to FMS form start:** 10–15%
* **Form start → submit:** 35–45%
* **Contact connect (within 24h):** 65–80%
* **Connected → scheduled:** 75–90%
* **Scheduled → show‑up:** 70–80%

**Resulting monthly outcomes**

* **Conservative:** 1,000 × 12% × 40% × 70% × 80% × 75% ≈ **20–25 screens**
* **Base:** 1,400 × 13% × 40% × 72% × 82% × 75% ≈ **30–40 screens**
* **Upside:** 1,800 × 15% × 45% × 75% × 85% × 80% ≈ **45–60 screens**

> **Sanity check with weekly targets:** 8–12 leads/week ramping to 12–18 aligns with **\~35–60 leads/mo**, yielding **\~25–45 completed screens/mo** at typical downstream rates.

### Capacity Note

* Ensure **screening slots** exist for the upside case (e.g., 12–15/wk). Maintain an overflow plan (waitlist SMS + next‑week holds).

## 8) Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                         | Likely Impact                      | Mitigation                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Competitors push free trials | Perceived lower barrier vs our FMS | Frame **assessment > free class**; show member stories; emphasize safety and faster progress     |
| Manual scheduling delay      | Lead decay and no‑shows            | Same‑day callback window; SMS templates; simple slot inventory; 2‑touch cadence                  |
| Low interview yield          | Weak qual insights                 | Flexible time slots; recruit via confirmations + on‑site prompts; incentives (free mobility PDF) |
| Price opacity in market      | Positioning ambiguity              | Use review text/FAQs to triangulate; test value messaging vs hard price                          |
| Seasonality / events         | Volatile traffic                   | Compare against prior‑month patterns; hold tests during swings                                   |
| Drop‑ins contaminate funnel  | KPI noise                          | Separate Drop‑in page CTA; exclude from FMS metrics                                              |
| Consent/privacy gaps         | Trust and compliance risk          | Clear consent copy; data minimization; opt‑out and retention window                              |
