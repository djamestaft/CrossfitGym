**Client:** Geelong Movement Co (CrossFit + Physiotherapy)
**Prepared by:** Mary — Business Analyst (BMAD) / John — Product Manager
**Date:** September 12, 2025
**Status:** Working Draft (Not yet approved)

## 1) Executive Summary

Geelong Movement Co (GMC) will deliver a focused 4‑week MVP revamp of the public website that funnels visitors toward a **Functional Movement Screen (FMS)** as the primary conversion event while enabling member retention and SEO-driven discovery. The MVP uses a low-cost stack (**Next.js + Vercel + Sanity**) to minimize operational complexity and lays groundwork for post‑MVP toggles (Cliniko booking, payments, portal depth). Key outcomes: increase qualified FMS leads; reduce time-to-first-session; strengthen local SEO; improve member stickiness via a lightweight portal.

---

## 2) Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goal

Drive qualified FMS leads and convert them into first sessions efficiently and safely.

### MVP KPIs (First 4 weeks post-launch)

* **Lead Gen & Conversion:** Week‑1 baseline; **+50%** FMS leads by Week‑4; form completion **≥70%**; FMS→first session **≥60%**; median **TTF ≤5 days**.
* **Member Engagement:** ≥ **40%** of active members log into portal weekly.
* **Content/SEO:** Publish **4** articles + **2** condition hubs; organic mix **≥20%**; Google Business Profile (GBP) actions **+20%** vs. pre‑launch.
* **Quality/Performance:** Core Web Vitals thresholds (LCP ≤2.5s, CLS ≤0.1, INP ≤200ms) pass on **≥75%** of page views; **≥99.9%** uptime.

### Measurement Plan

GA4 events: `fms_start`, `fms_submit`, (manual) `first_session_booked`, `chat_open`, `call_click`, `map_click`, `portal_login`, `video_play`, `post_view`.
GSC/GBP tracked for impressions/clicks; ops sheet cohorts compute conversion + median days.

---

## 3) Target Users & Personas (JTBD)

1. **Cautious Beginner** — “Help me start with confidence so I don’t get hurt.”
2. **Returning Athlete (post‑niggle/injury)** — “Show me a plan to train now while I rehab.”
3. **Busy Parent/Professional** — “Give me efficient sessions and a clear path to results.”
4. **Current Member** — “Keep me consistent and progressing.”

Primary value props: assessment‑led onboarding (FMS) → personalized plan; physio‑informed coaching; community & accountability.

---

## 4) Key Features & Functionality (MVP)

* **FMS Conversion Funnel:** Dedicated FMS landing; **two‑step form**; success page with next steps; admin notification + basic lead storage; GA4 events.
* **Read‑Only Timetable:** Fitbox read or CMS fallback; responsive; timezone/holiday notes.
* **Member Portal (Light):** Email/magic‑link gate; programming notes; movement library (≥12 videos); member FAQs.
* **Content Engine:** 2 condition hubs + 4 articles; schema; internal links; SEO hygiene.
* **Trust & Proof:** Testimonials (≥6), coach bios (≥3 with quals), safety/standards panel.
* **Chat Toggle:** Tawk.to enabled via CMS toggle; default on in **Week +1**.

## 5) MVP Scope & Non‑Goals

### In Scope (MVP)

Public site (Home, FMS, Programs, Timetable, Pricing, Coaches, Blog, Contact), lightweight portal, content engine, analytics/SEO, CMS schemas, Tawk.to toggle, hosting on Vercel.

### Out of Scope (Deferred)

Online booking/payments; trial sign‑ups; advanced portal (PR tracking, messaging); CRM automation; Fitbox write operations; e‑commerce; native app.

Rationale: strict MVP to validate FMS-led funnel; reduce delivery risk and cost.

---

## 6) Critical User Journeys

**A. Visitor → FMS (Primary)**

1. Home/FMS landing → proof & safety → 2‑step form; 2) Success page promise (contact within 1 business day); 3) Staff follow‑up → first session scheduled.
   Instrumentation: `fms_start`, `fms_submit`, manual `first_session_booked`.

**B. Member → Portal**
Login/email gate → programming notes → movement video (captioned).
Instrumentation: `portal_login`, `video_play`, `post_view`.

**C. Searcher → Condition Hub**
Query (e.g., “shoulder pain crossfit”) → condition hub (dos/don’ts, drills, snippets) → soft CTA to FMS.
Schema: Article, FAQ; LocalBusiness on Contact.

Edge cases: form partials (no automations v1); holiday notes via CMS; accessibility basics in place.

---

Routing: shallow core routes; hubs at `/hubs/shoulder`, `/hubs/low-back`; internal links hub ↔ articles ↔ FMS.

* **CMS:** Sanity (role‑based access); schemas per content map.

## 15) Post‑MVP Backlog (Toggles & Next Bets)

1. Cliniko booking embed (FMS success/Contact).
2. Intro offer / Trial flow (no payments v1) → Stripe Link later.
3. Payments (intro offers) after funnel proof.
4. Fitbox write hooks (in‑site booking) with guardrails.
5. Capacity heatmap on Timetable.
6. Referral mechanics; shareable success; UTM referral tracking.
7. Portal depth (PR tracking, messaging, saved scaling notes).
8. Email sequences (abandoners, pre‑session prep, onboarding).
9. Case studies & staff bios video.
10. A/B experiments (FMS headline, proof density, CTA; hub CTA placement).

Principles: activate only if they improve **FMS → First Session** or reduce **TTF**; use CMS‑config toggles; weekly increments; sunset weak performers.
