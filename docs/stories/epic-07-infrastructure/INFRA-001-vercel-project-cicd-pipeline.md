## üß™ Testing Criteria

- [ ] **Deployment Testing:**
  - Successful deployment from feature branch to preview
  - Successful deployment from main branch to production
  - Rollback procedure tested and timed (<1 minute)
  - Environment variable access verified in all environments

- [ ] **Quality Gate Testing:**
  - CI/CD pipeline fails appropriately on broken code
  - Performance budgets trigger build failures when exceeded
  - Security vulnerabilities block deployment
  - All quality checks pass on clean codebase

- [ ] **Performance Testing:**
  - Core Web Vitals thresholds met on production
  - CDN cache hit rates >90% for static assets
  - Edge function response times <200ms
  - Image optimization reducing file sizes >50%

  - Environment variable management guide created
  - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - Security procedures documented and reviewed

- [ ] **Team Readiness:**
  - Team training completed on new workflow
  - Access permissions verified for all team members
  - Emergency procedures communicated
  - On-call rotation and escalation defined

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

| Risk                      | Impact | Probability | Mitigation                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Vercel service outage     | High   | Low         | Multi-region setup, status monitoring      |
| Environment variable leak | High   | Medium      | Proper secrets management, access auditing |
| Build pipeline failure    | Medium | Medium      | Comprehensive testing, fallback procedures |
| Domain/DNS issues         | High   | Low         | Multiple DNS providers, TTL optimization   |

## üìà Success Metrics

- **Deployment Frequency:** Target 5-10 deployments per week
- **Deployment Success Rate:** >95% successful deployments
- **Mean Time to Deploy:** <5 minutes from merge to live
- **Mean Time to Rollback:** <1 minute to previous version
- **Uptime Target:** >99.9% availability from Day 1
