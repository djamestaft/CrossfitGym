export async function GET() {
  const checks = await Promise.all([
    checkDatabase(),
    checkSanityCMS(),
    checkFitboxAPI(),
    checkEmailService(),
  ])

  const allHealthy = checks.every(check => check.status === 'healthy')

  return Response.json(
    {
      status: allHealthy ? 'healthy' : 'degraded',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      checks: checks,
    },
    {
      status: allHealthy ? 200 : 503,
    }
  )
}
```

### Uptime Check Configuration

```javascript
// monitoring/uptime-checks.js
const uptimeChecks = [
  {
    name: 'Homepage',
    url: 'https://geelongmovement.com',
    interval: '5min',
    timeout: '10s',
    expectedStatus: 200,
    expectedContent: 'FMS Assessment',
  },
  {
    name: 'FMS Form',
    url: 'https://geelongmovement.com/fms',
    interval: '5min',
    timeout: '10s',
    expectedStatus: 200,
    expectedContent: 'Contact Details',
  },
  {
    name: 'Portal Authentication',
